"""
Unit tests for predict function.

Test scenarios explicitly. The utility of the tests here are:

1. Introducing someone to this project should be a 
    breeze because they understand expectations, caveats, tricky cases here.

2. Improving components doesn't break an existing feature, because there is a test
    here to know about that.

3. The exceptions on sentry are minimal to none.

The tests here are not solid, they are just starting points.
